    "In this project we automate the process of generating LinkedIn content for you, using CrewAI, ChatGPT, and Python. Instead of drafting it all by yourself you can instead run this project to get all your weekly content! In fact, a popular LinkedIn Influencer, Lara Acosta, made a video on how to use ChatGPT to generate viral LinkedIn content with her own expert strategy. You can find this information in the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYBObTusysQ. But here we will automate this process so you don't even need to follow it - literally all you need to do instead is just input a message about yourself/personal brand, and then this program will generate content all the content for you in a nice document. It's basically an AI Lara Acosta!\n",

    "It's relatively simple, but the power is in the customization that you can add to it - here is the GitHub repo: https://github.com/RavinderRai/linkedin-content-automation. Also note that you can give these AI Agents tools, which are basically functions to do things like scrape the web, search youtube, etc. So you could make them do things like market research on your behalf! In any case, here's an image to illustrate how this whole process works. \n",

In this case no tools were necessary as we simply followed Lara's instructions in her original video (which only involved prompt engineering), but this is where the magic really happens. Reason being is that you can define tools for agents to scrape the web to get up to date information, or search youtube, or load in data from an API, and who knows what else - sky's the limit. Anyway, here's the template code for defining your tools."
